  <!-- Why Quotes Matter -->
  <h2>Why Quotes Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Quotes are not just words — they are experiences condensed into a sentence. 
    They remind us of the struggles and victories of those who came before us. 
    A single line can inspire us to take action, offer comfort during difficult times, 
    or open our minds to new perspectives.
  </p>
  <p>
    By reading quotes daily, you develop a habit of reflection and positivity. 
    Whether you are a student, professional, or someone simply seeking wisdom, 
    these words can brighten your day and guide your journey.
