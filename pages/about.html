      Welcome to our Quote Website — a place where words inspire, motivate, and heal. 
      This platform was created with a simple belief: a single line can change the way we look at life. 
      Whether it’s a reminder to stay strong during tough times or a spark of joy in your everyday routine, 
      we gather quotes that speak directly to the heart.

    <p>
      What started as a small collection of personal favorites has now grown into a community space 
      where readers from around the world come to find wisdom, comfort, and motivation.
